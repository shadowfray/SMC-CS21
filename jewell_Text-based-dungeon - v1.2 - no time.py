The idea of The Keep of The Dreamer is a short text based adventure game where
you explore a set of interconnected rooms in search of treasure. The character
can move between the game's 5 total rooms, and can backtrack and move on the
grid however they like. Text input is the only way to interface with the game,
and a set of list of actions for each room has been provided. Some of the items
and objects in each of the rooms can only be interacted with if certain conditions
have been met, say you pulled a lever in the next room or are carrying the key to
the door. To make this work, each of the rooms is it's own function, allowing for
easy branching between each chamber. Each room has it's own set list of what you
can and can't interact with, and the actions in the room maybe be able to even
affect other rooms. As such, the list of events and inventory are passed between
room as parameters so that the game can use them as a way to check what has and
has not been done.

The command function serves as a way for players to know what they can and cannot
do. While it is not an overly complex piece of code, it is used in every room and
thus saves time and space. It takes a single parameter, the dictionary of available
actions in each room, and iterates over the keys that have a value of True and
printing them out to the user.

Room22 is the first room the players enter when playing the game. Since all rooms are
almost identical, this room will detail the process of all rooms. Each room has a
dictionary of available objects and items that the player can interact with, the ones
that can currently be interacted with being True, while hidden objects are False. The
dictionary also includes the 3 universal commands of the game, commands, which tells
the user what they can and cannot do, using the commands() function, the investigate
function, which reveals hidden objects and items to the user, and inventory, which
displays the current inventory of the player. From here, there is a loop that runs,
asking the user for input. If the input is is on the item list for the room, and it
is also set to true, it allows for interaction. The user picks up something, the
item will be set as True in their inventory. When moving to the next room, the next
room function will be called, passing the events dictionary and the inventory
dictionary along. Room 22 itself has a rusted lever in it that can lower the
drawbridge in Room 23 if oil from another room is used on it. There is also a blue
ring here that can absorb lightning if carried into room 14, as well as a scroll that
hints at the gem offering in Room 24. There is a gate leading here to Room 23, and
there is an exit here. You cannot leave without the amulet'
